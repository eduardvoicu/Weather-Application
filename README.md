# Weather Application
by Eduard Voicu

## User Story
```
AS a USER I would like to get the CURRENT weather and a 5 Day Forecast of the CITY
I search for.
AS a DEVELOPER in this deployed app, I created a WEATHER DASHBOARD that will grab the current weather for ANY city that
A USER WOULD search for. When USER hits search, USER is presented with a current weather conditions as well as a 5 DAY forecast.
IT also has a SEARCH HISTORY to REFRESH their memory of PREVIOUS searches.
